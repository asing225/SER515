                <p>The vision for Drag-On is that this project is a fully functional stand-alone application 
                        to aid students from grades 1 to 6 in applying arithmetic expressions and evaluating their 
                        functionality using visual programming elements such as modules and blocks.
                    </p><br>
                <p>Drag-On is a visual aided playground specifically developed for children aged between 6 to 16, 
                    in order to help them strengthen their understanding of standard arithmetic expression.
                </p><br>
                <p>This project extends its imagination from that of SCRATCH by MIT (https://scratch.mit.edu/) 
                    which shares a similar goal in developing a creative environment for learning.

                <p>
                    This application delivers a system that can be used by an entity such as a school, where the Drag-On 
                    playground is available for students to learn and the teachers can use this application to create quizzes 
                    or the students to learn and grow.
